# PXLP Photos
## Basically pixel art but editable by programmers
---
### A few things first of all
1. I stole the .tmlanguage code from the [Microsoft JSON VSCode Extention](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-JSON.tmLanguage/tree/main). Please don't kill me.
2. It is basically just .json but with 4 main elements(explanation in the file)
3. There is also a VSCode extension for .pxlp to download for better use.

### Editing
#### There is an editing guide in the example.pxlp file for those who need it, but there is a built-in editor so idk why you would ever use it.
